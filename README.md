# machine-learning-project

I developed some machine learning and data mining projects, covering data cleaning / preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, prediction model development (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN classifier, Time Series etc), and model performance assessment (accuracy rate, cross validation, AUC, confusion matrix, F1 score, partial dependence plot etc).

The summary of each project as below.

1. House pricing prediction; linear regression
* With 80 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa to predict the final price of each home.

2. Australia current listings prediction; linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting
* Provide pricing recommendations and defend my assertions / claims with data by analyzing linear regression model.

3. Hypothesis testing for Uber's SFO and LAX marketing campaigns
* Hypothesis testing on analyzing the SFO and LAX datasets, determine if either marketing campaign was successful in raising the average miles driven per Uber driver.

4. Predict employee turnover; logistic regression
* Use logistic regression to determine the causes for attrition, and predict when employees are going to leave a company, assess the performance of my model.

5. Customers transaction prediction; logistic regression
* Use logistic regression to determine the causes for transaction, predict when customers are going to transact, and assess the performance of my model.

6. Baseball players' salary prediction; ridge & lasso regularization
* Use lasso & ridge regularization to predict salary for a baseball player, clearly explain the output of the regularized models (specifically, those variables that have been shrunk and why).

7. Time series forecasting â€” ARIMA model
* Analyze 2 data sets, predict the values for the next 8 time periods and the subsequent 7 years (with confidence intervals), and make 3 observations about the data (i.e., describe its composition and characteristics).

8. Customer churn prediction in telecom industry; using several machine learning techniques
* Apply logistic regression(lasso & ridge), decision tree, KNN classifier, and random forest to predict potential customer churn and customer life time value in telecom insudtry. Provide the best model that has achieved the highest AUC value with lowest MSE(Mean Squared Error).

9. Predict the player's active days of Civilization VI (video game); multiple regression model and ridge regression 

- Conduct the feature engineering, linear regression assumption, and use multiple regression model with ridge regression to predict the player's active days. Determine which features are significant by evaluating the coefficient and p-value.
