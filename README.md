# machine-learning-project

This repository contains the machine learning and data mining projects I have developed. Covering data cleaning / preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, prediction model development (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN classifier, Time Series etc), and model performance assessment (accuracy rate, cross validation, AUC, confusion matrix, F1 score, partial dependence plot etc).

The summary of each project as below.

1. House Pricing Prediction; Linear Regression

- With 80 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa to predict the final price of each home.

2. Australia Rental Listings Prediction; Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting

- Provide pricing recommendations and defend my assertions / claims with data by analyzing linear regression model.

3. Hypothesis Testing for Uber's SFO and LAX Marketing Campaigns

- Hypothesis testing on analyzing the SFO and LAX datasets, determine if either marketing campaign was successful in raising the average miles driven per Uber driver.

4. Predict Employee Turnover; Logistic Regression

- Create logistic regression to determine the causes for attrition, and predict when employees are going to leave a company, assess the performance of my model.

5. Customers Transaction Prediction; Logistic Regression

- Develop logistic regression to determine the causes for transaction, predict when customers are going to transact, and assess the performance of my model.

6. Baseball Player's Salary Prediction; Ridge & Lasso Regularization

- Build lasso & ridge regularization to predict salary for a baseball player, clearly explain the output of the regularized models (specifically, those variables that have been shrunk and why).

7. Time Series Forecasting â€” ARIMA
- Analyze 2 data sets, predict the values for the next 8 time periods and the subsequent 7 years (with confidence intervals), and make 3 observations about the data (i.e., describe its composition and characteristics).

8. Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry; Several Machine Learning Techniques

- Construct logistic regression(lasso & ridge), decision tree, KNN classifier, and random forest to predict potential customer churn and customer life time value in telecom industry. 

- Provide the best model that has achieved the highest AUC value with lowest MSE(Mean Squared Error).

9. Predict the Civilization VI Game Player's Active Days; Multiple Regression Model with Ridge Regularization

- Develop the feature engineering, linear regression assumption, and use multiple regression model with ridge regression to predict the player's active days. Determine which features are significant by evaluating the coefficients and p-values.

10. CTR Values Prediction; Time Series Models

- Develop Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, Autoregressive and ARIMA model to forecast CTR (click through rate), and identify which model performs best.
