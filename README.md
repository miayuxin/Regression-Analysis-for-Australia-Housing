# machine-learning-project

I developed some machine learning projects, covering data cleaning / preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
data visualization, time series forcasting, model development, and model performance assessment.

1. House prices prediction: advanced regression techniques
- With 80 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa to predict the final price of each home.

2. Linear regression; predict Australia current listings
- Provide pricing recommendations and defend my assertions / claims with data by analyzing linear regression model.

3. Hypothesis testing for Uber's SFO and LAX marketing campaigns
- Hypothesis testing on analyzing the SFO and LAX data sets, determine if either marketing campaign was successful in raising the average miles driven per Uber driver.

4. Predict employee turnover; logistic regression
- Use logistic regression to determine the causes for attrition, and predict when employees are going to leave a company, assess the performance of my model.

5. Customers transaction prediction; logistic regression
- Use logistic regression to determine the causes for transaction, predict when customers are going to transact, and assess the performance of my model.

6. Baseball players' salary prediction; regularization
- Use lasso & ridge regularization to predict salary for a baseball player, clearly explain the output of the regularized models (specifically, those variables that have been shrunk and why).

7. Time series forecasting â€” ARIMA model
- Analyze 2 data sets, predict the values for the next 8 time periods and the subsequent 7 years (with confidence intervals), and 
make 3 observations about the data (i.e., describe its composition and characteristics).
