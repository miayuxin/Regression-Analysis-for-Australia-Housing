# machine-learning-project

I developed many Machine Learning and Data Mining projects, covering data cleaning / preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series forcasting, prediction model development(linear regression, logistic regression, and random forest etc), and assessed the model performance.

1. EDA and Linear regression; house prices prediction
- With 80 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa to predict the final price of each home.

2. Linear regression; predict Australia current listings
- Developed linear regression model to provide pricing recommendations and defend my assertions / claims.

3. Hypothesis testing; Uber's SFO and LAX marketing campaigns
- Hypothesis testing on analyzing the SFO and LAX data sets, determine if either marketing campaign was successful in raising the average miles driven per Uber driver.

4. Predict employee turnover; logistic regression
- Used logistic regression to determine the causes for attrition, and predict when employees are going to leave a company, assess the performance of my model.

5. Customers transaction prediction; logistic regression
- Used logistic regression to determine the causes for transaction, predict when customers are going to transact, and assess the performance of my model.

6. Baseball players' salary prediction; lasso & ridge regularization
- Used lasso & ridge regularization to predict salary for a baseball player, clearly explained the output of the regularized models (specifically, those variables that have been shrunk and why).

7. Time series forecasting — ARIMA model
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Analyze 2 data sets, predict the values for the next 8 time periods and the subsequent 7 years (with confidence intervals), and 
make 3 observations about the data (i.e., describe its composition and characteristics).
=======
- Analyzed 2 data sets, predicted the values for the next 8 time periods and the subsequent 7 years (with confidence intervals), and 
made 3 observations about the data (i.e., described its composition and characteristics).

8. Telcom customer churn — data mining with several machine learning methods
- Applied logistic regression(lasso & ridge), decision tree, KNN classifier, and random forest to predict potential customer churn and customer life time value in telecom insudtry.
