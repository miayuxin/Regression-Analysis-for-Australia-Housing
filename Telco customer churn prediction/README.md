# Telco customer churn prediction

## Introduction 

#### Current problems in telco market
In today's technology era, the technical progress and the increasing number of operators raised the level of competition, 
telecommunications companies are working hard to survive in this competitive market.

#### Importance of customer churn
Due to the direct effect on the revenues of the companies, telecom companies are seeking to develop means to predict potential customer to churn. So that they can build a strategy to increase the retention period of customers.

#### Main contribution of my work
Using machine learning techniques to develop a churn prediction model which assists telecom operators to predict customers who are most likely subject to churn.

#### Embed insights into the company
Provide the best model that has achieved the highest AUC value for a company to predict the churn of customers.

## Dataset

This IBM sample dataset has information about telco customers, and if they left the company within the last month (churn).  
The data set contains informations about Telco customers where each row represents a unique customers and the columns are informations regarding customersâ€™services.
There are a total of 7,032 customers in the dataset among which 1,869 left within the last month.
With a churn rate that high, i.e 26.58%, Telco may run out of customers in the coming months if no action is taken.

## Problem Definition

- What are the factors influent the churn?
- How to predict the churn, and customer life-time values?

## Models development  

I built and compared the classification models for predicting the potential customer churn, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN Classifier, and Random Forest.

For instance, the model development process of one of the models - Random Forest as below:

## Result 





## Customer life-time value prediction
