## Time Series Models Development
Developed a list of time series models includeing Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, Autoregressive, and ARIMA model to identify which model performs best.
Below is an example of ARIMA model.

## Conclusion 
The result shows ARIMA model performs best with the lowest mean square error 1.06994e-07.
