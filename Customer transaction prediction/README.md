## Goal 
Use logistic regression to predict a consumerâ€™s propensity to purchase products.

## Grid Search
To increase the accuracy score, I used the Grid Search with 5 folds cross validations to identify the best hyperparameters for running logistic regression model.  
After applying it, the average accuracy score has increased from 90% to 92%.

## Confusion Matrix and AUC score

However, Since I am dealing with imbalanced dataset, the accuracy is not the best metric to use.

Thus, I also looked at the confusin matrix and AUC score.
